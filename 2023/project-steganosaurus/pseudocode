read inputfile<x>
transfer inputfile<x> into bitstream

input secret -> could be a pgp key.
	e.g. pgp key -> CB536D9E10B1251DD59CBF686CA79961EA6170E3 -> hexstring-len-40, i.e. bitlength is 40*4=160
with secret -> calculate bitlength of secret

break inputfile.bitstream into len(secret.bitlength) blocks

for each block:
	take last bit, change it to whatever the secret bit is.


to read the secret, take this altered file, break into y blocks read the last bit of each block

-----------------


use random floats until you have blocks of 160 blocks of 100 char.
